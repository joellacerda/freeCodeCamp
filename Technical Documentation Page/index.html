            CSS page layout techniques allow us to take elements contained in a
            web page and control where they're positioned relative to the
            following factors: their default position in normal layout flow, the
            other elements around them, their parent container, and the main
            viewport/window. The page layout techniques we'll be covering in
            more detail in this module are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Normal flow</li>
            <li>Flexbox</li>
            <li>Grid</li>
            <li>Floats</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Each technique has its uses, advantages, and disadvantages. No
            technique is designed to be used in isolation. By understanding what
            each layout method is designed for you'll be in a good position to
            understand which method is most appropriate for each task.

            Normal flow is how the browser lays out HTML pages by default when
            you do nothing to control page layout. HTML is displayed in the
            exact order in which it appears in the source code, with elements
            stacked on top of one another — the first paragraph, followed by the
            unordered list, followed by the second paragraph. Let's look at a
            quick HTML example:
          </p>

          <code
            ><p>I love my cat.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Buy cat food</li>
              <li>Exercise</li>
              <li>Cheer up friend</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The end!</p></code
          >
          <p>
            The elements that appear one below the other are described as block
            elements, in contrast to inline elements, which appear beside one
            another like the individual words in a paragraph.
          </p>
          <p>
            The methods that can change how elements are laid out in CSS are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The display property</li>
            <li>The position property</li>
            <li>Table layout</li>
            <li>Multi-column layout</li>
          </ul>
        </article>

      <section class="main-section" id="Flexbox">
        <header>Flexbox</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Flexbox is the short name for the Flexible Box Layout CSS module,
            designed to make it easy for us to lay things out in one dimension —
            either as a row or as a column. To use flexbox, you apply display:
            flex to the parent element of the elements you want to lay out; all
            its direct children then become flex items. We can see this in a
            simple example.
          </p>
          <h4>Setting display: flex</h4>
          <p>
            The HTML markup below gives us a containing element with a class of
            wrapper, inside of which are three div elements. By default these
            would display as block elements, that is, below one another in our
            English language document.
          </p>
          <code
            >.wrapper {<br />
            display: flex;<br />
            }</code
          >
          <p>
            However, by adding
            <code class="inline-code">display: flex</code>
            to the parent, the three items now arrange themselves into columns.
            This is due to them becoming flex items and being affected by some
            initial values that flexbox sets on the flex container. They are
            displayed in a row because the property flex-direction of the parent
            element has an initial value of row. They all appear to stretch in
            height because the property align-items of their parent element has
            an initial value of stretch. This means that the items stretch to
            the height of the flex container, which in this case is defined by
            the tallest item. The items all line up at the start of the
            container, leaving any extra space at the end of the row.
          </p>

          <p>
            While flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layout, Grid Layout is
            designed for two dimensions — lining things up in rows and columns.
          </p>
          <h4>Setting display: grid</h4>
          <p>
            Similar to flexbox, we enable Grid Layout with its specific display
            value — <code class="inline-code">display: grid</code>. The below
            example uses similar markup to the flex example, with a container
            and some child elements. In addition to using
            <code class="inline-code">display: grid</code>, we also define some
            row and column tracks for the parent using the grid-template-rows
            and grid-template-columns properties respectively. We've defined
            three columns, each of 1fr, as well as two rows of 100px. We don't
            need to put any rules on the child elements; they're automatically
            placed into the cells our grid's created.
          </p>
          <code
            >.wrapper {<br />display: grid;<br />grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr
            1fr;<br />
            grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;<br />
            gap: 10px;<br />
            }</code

        <article>
          <p>
            Floating an element changes the behavior of that element and the
            block level elements that follow it in normal flow. The floated
            element is moved to the left or right and removed from normal flow,
            and the surrounding content floats around it.
          </p>
          <p>The float property has four possible values:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>left — Floats the element to the left.</li>
            <li>right — Floats the element to the right.</li>
            <li>
              none — Specifies no floating at all. This is the default value.
            </li>
            <li>
              inherit — Specifies that the value of the float property should be
              inherited from the element's parent element.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In the example below, we float a div left and give it a margin on
            the right to push the surrounding text away from it. This gives us
            the effect of text wrapped around the boxed element, and is most of
            what you need to know about floats as used in modern web design.
          </p>
          <code>
            <div
              style="
                float: left;
                width: 150px;
                height: 150px;
                margin-right: 30px;
              "
            >
              Float box
            </div>
